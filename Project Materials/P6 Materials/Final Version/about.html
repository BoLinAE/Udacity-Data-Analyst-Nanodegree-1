	<h1> <center> About Emissions Explorer </center> </h1>
	<div class="text">
		The Global Emisions Explorer is a tool designed to allow for simple interpretation and comparison of carbon dioxide emissions data. All data is from the <a href="http://cait.wri.org/"> Climate Analysis Indicators Tool </a> developed by the World Resources Institute. The data is publically available for download <a href="http://www.wri.org/resources/data-sets/cait-historical-emissions-data-countries-us-states-unfccc"> online </a>. There are two main parts to the emissions exploration tool. An interactive map allows you to visualize global emissions for any year from 1850 to 2013. Options include entering a specific year, or watching as emissions grow decade by decade from 1850. Hovering over a countries' emission bubble will give you the CO2 emissions information for that country and year (in millions of metric tons) as well as the countries' global rank (lower is better in this case!). The chart option allows for additional exploration. Multiple countries can be selected and compared from 1850 to 2013. The global emissions explorer will be updated with additional data as it becomes available. This tool was created using d3.js as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Degree.
